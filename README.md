Code for the paper 'Energy Efficiency in Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks'

As sensor networks for health monitoring become more prevalent,
so will the need to control their usage and consumption of energy.
This paper presents a method which leverages the algorithm’s performance
and energy consumption. By utilising Reinforcement Learning
(RL) techniques, we provide an adaptive framework, which continuously
performs weak training in an energy-aware system. We motivate this
using a realistic example of residential localisation based on Received
Signal Strength (RSS). The method is cheap in terms of work-hours,
calibration and energy usage. It achieves this by utilising other sensors
available in the environment. These other sensors provide weak labels,
which are then used to employ the State-Action-Reward-State-Action
(SARSA) algorithm and train the model over time. Our approach is
evaluated on a simulated localisation environment and validated on a
widely available pervasive health dataset which facilitates realistic residential
localisation using RSS. We show that our method is cheaper to
implement and requires less effort, whilst at the same time providing a
performance enhancement and energy savings over time.
